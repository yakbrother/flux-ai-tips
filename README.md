### Generation Parameters

#### üéõÔ∏è **Key Settings**
```python
# Typical parameter ranges
steps: 20-50          # More steps = higher quality (diminishing returns after 30)
guidance_scale: 3.5-7.5   # Higher = more prompt adherence (7.5 is standard)
width: 512-1536       # Image width in pixels
height: 512-1536      # Image height in pixels
seed: 0-4294967295    # For reproducible results
```

#### ‚öôÔ∏è **Advanced Parameters**

# Fine-tuning options
scheduler: "euler_a"  # Sampling method (euler_a, dpm++, etc.)
num_inference_steps: 28  # Quality vs speed trade-off
strength: 0.7         # For img2img - how much to change (0.1-1.0)
controlnet_conditioning_scale: 1.0  # ControlNet influence
```

## Seeds & Reproducibility

### Understanding Seeds

A **seed** is a number that controls the randomness in AI generation. Same seed + same prompt + same settings = identical image.

#### üé≤ **Seed Basics**
- **Range**: 0 to 4,294,967,295 (32-bit integer)
- **Default**: Random seed if not specified
- **Purpose**: Reproduce exact results or create variations

#### üîÑ **Seed Strategies**

**For Exploration:**
```python
# Let system choose random seeds
seed: -1  # or omit seed parameter
# Good for: Initial exploration, finding good compositions
```

**For Refinement:**
```python
# Use specific seed from good result
seed: 42891057
# Good for: Tweaking prompts while keeping composition
```

**For Variations:**
```python
# Increment seed for similar but different results
seed: 42891057  # Original
seed: 42891058  # Slight variation
seed: 42891059  # Another variation
```

### Practical Seed Workflows

#### üéØ **The Seed Discovery Process**

1. **Initial Generation** (Random Seeds)
   ```
   Prompt: "Portrait of a woman, golden hour lighting"
   Seed: Random
   Generate: 4-8 images
   ```

2. **Identify Best Composition**
   ```
   Best result seed: 1847362819
   Save this seed for refinement
   ```

3. **Prompt Refinement** (Fixed Seed)
   ```
   Seed: 1847362819 (kept constant)
   Prompt iterations:
   - "Portrait of a woman, golden hour lighting, 85mm lens"
   - "Portrait of a woman, golden hour lighting, 85mm lens, film photography"
   - "Portrait of a woman, golden hour lighting, 85mm lens, Kodak Portra 400"
   ```

4. **Final Variations** (Seed Range)
   ```
   Final prompt + seeds: 1847362819, 1847362820, 1847362821
   Choose best final result
   ```

#### üìä **Seed Organization**
```
Project: Fashion Shoot
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Exploration Seeds: Random (discovery phase)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Golden Seeds: 1847362819, 2956184730 (keeper compositions)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Variation Seeds: +1, +2, +3 from golden seeds
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Final Seeds: Selected seeds for delivery
```

## Start Images & Img2Img

### Image-to-Image Workflow

Img2Img uses an existing image as a starting point, allowing you to transform photos into different styles while maintaining composition.

#### üñºÔ∏è **Start Image Preparation**

**Optimal Start Images:**
- **Resolution**: Match your target output (1024x1024, 1536x1024, etc.)
- **Composition**: Strong, clear composition translates better
- **Lighting**: Good contrast and defined shadows/highlights
- **Subject**: Clear subject definition for better transformation

**Image Preprocessing:**
```python
# Resize to target dimensions
target_size: (1024, 1024)
resize_method: "crop_center"  # or "stretch", "pad"

# Optional: Enhance contrast/clarity before input
preprocessing: "auto_contrast"
```

#### ‚öôÔ∏è **Strength Parameter Control**

The `strength` parameter controls how much the AI changes your start image:

| Strength | Effect | Use Case |
|----------|--------|----------|
| 0.1-0.3 | Minimal changes | Color correction, lighting adjustment |
| 0.4-0.6 | Moderate transformation | Style transfer, artistic interpretation |
| 0.7-0.8 | Major changes | Complete style overhaul |
| 0.9-1.0 | Nearly from scratch | Use composition only |

#### üé® **Img2Img Techniques**

**Style Transfer:**
```python
start_image: "portrait_photo.jpg"
