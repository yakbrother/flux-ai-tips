ðŸ§µ Thread: "From $0 to $10k/month with AI art - here's how I did it:"

1/10 Started with basic Flux AI tutorials, spending hours watching YouTube videos and getting mediocre results. There had to be a better way...

2/10 Discovered the secret isn't just better prompts - it's understanding PHOTOGRAPHY principles. Aperture, lighting, composition - they all translate to AI.

3/10 Game-changer: Learning seed control. Same composition, different styles. Clients love consistency + variations. One good seed = 20+ profitable images.

4/10 Pricing strategy matters. Don't compete on price. Compete on speed, quality, and understanding client needs. Value-based pricing changed everything.

5/10 Real numbers: Started at $25/image, now averaging $150/image with $2k+ brand packages. Same time investment, 6x revenue.
